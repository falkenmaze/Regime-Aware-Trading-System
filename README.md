# Regime Aware Trading System
This project implements a **regime-aware trading system** that adapts its strategy based on market regimes. It uses macroeconomic and price-based indicators to detect regimes like bull and bear, then applies tailored strategies within each regime. The system is backtested using historical SPY data, with risk controls such as stop-losses and position sizing in place.

## ðŸ“ˆ Strategy Used 

### 1. **Regime Detection**
- Utilizes a **Hidden Markov Model** to detect different market regimes.
- Regimes are labeled as `bull` or `bear` based on model state and return characteristics.

### 2. **Regime-Specific Trading**
- **Bull Regime**: Trend-following strategy using moving average crossover or momentum.
- **Bear Regime**: Defensive strategy based on moving average and bollinger bands crossover.

## Backtesting Engine

- **Capital**: `$100,000` starting capital.
- **Trade Sizing**: Fixed percentage of capital (e.g., 25%) with a **1% risk cap** per trade.
- **Partial Exits**: Sells a configurable percentage (e.g., 30%) on each sell signal.
- **Stop Loss**: Dynamic stop-loss applied per trade (default: 10%).
- **Performance Tracking**: Portfolio value, trades, durations, and more.
